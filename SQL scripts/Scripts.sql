[ Logic - Z-Score Method (Standard Deviation Rule) We assume that most invoice totals are 
 	clustered around the average (mean). To find outliers (unusually high or low invoices), 
	we calculate how far an invoiceâ€™s total is from the average.

	This is based on the empirical rule from statistics:
	About 95% of values fall within Â±2 standard deviations from the mean.
	So anything beyond that is statistically rare = unusual.
	
	ðŸ§  Breakdown:
	avg_sales: average invoice total
	stddev_sales: how spread out the sales values are
	If an invoice is far above or below average, it might be a suspicious transaction, bulk order, or error.]
